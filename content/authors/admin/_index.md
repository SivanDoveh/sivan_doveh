Hello! I'm Sivan, currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the Weizmann Institute of Science, under the guidance of Prof. Shimon Ullman. Additionally, I am working as a research scientist at IBM Research AI.
My research centers on vision and language, specifically aiming to improve compositional reasoning without the need for human annotations.
